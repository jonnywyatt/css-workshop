        <p>
          Scoot takes the hassle out of urban mobility. Our bikes are placed in
          convenient locations in each of our cities. Use our app to locate the
          nearest bike, unlock it with a tap, and you’re away!

            <h3>Locate with app</h3>
            <p>
              Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are
              continuously placing scooters in the areas with most demand, so
              one should never be too far away.

          <div>
            <h3>Pick your scooter</h3>
            <p>
              We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you.
              So you know how much charge they have left and can see roughly how
              much it will cost.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Enjoy the ride</h3>
            <p>
              Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock,
              put on a helmet, and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from
              walkways and accessibility ramps.

        <h2>Easy to use riding telemetry</h2>
        <p>
          The Scoot app is available with riding telemetry. This means it can
          show you your average speed, how long you've been using the scooter,
          your traveling distance, and many more things all in an easy to use
          app.
